Since 2022, I have been responsible for preparing and teaching the practical aspects of the course **Robotic
Manipulation in Space** at the University of Luxembourg. This course is led
by [Dr. Carol Martinez](https://carolmartinez.github.io) and offered to all third-semester students of
the [Interdisciplinary Space Master](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/study-programs/master-in-space-technologies-and-business).
The course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of kinematics, planning and control, with
a specific emphasis on robots operating in space.

The lectures emphasize hands-on experience through practical exercises and projects, enabling students to acquire a deep
understanding of robotic manipulation and its many complexities. By the end of the course, students work in teams to
develop realistic manipulation scenarios in the context of orbital or planetary space missions that their robots perform
autonomously. This approach ensures that students not only grasp theoretical concepts but also develop practical skills
directly applicable to real-world robotic manipulation.

The practical components of the course leverage the [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org) motion planning framework (MoveIt 1
in 2022 and MoveIt 2 since 2023). In addition to working with real PhantomX Pincher robots, we incorporate virtual and
simulated robots via [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) to underscore the importance of working with simulations in the
unstructured and unpredictable domain of space.
