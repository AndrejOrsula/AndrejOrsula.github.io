I have been preparing and teaching the practical aspects of **Robotic Manipulation in Space** at the University of Luxembourg. This course is led by [Dr. Carol Martinez](https://carolmartinez.github.io) and offered to all third-semester students of the [Interdisciplinary Space Master](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/study-programs/master-in-space-technologies-and-business). The curriculum emphasizes hands-on experience to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of kinematics, motion planning, and control of robots operating in space.
