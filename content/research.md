My passion for research was ignited through exposure
to [problem-based learning](https://www.en.aau.dk/about-aau/profile/pbl) during my studies at Aalborg University. This
immersive approach enabled me to address real-world problems with practical solutions, shaping my interests and
ultimately leading me to pursue a PhD.

I am currently focused on **Robot Learning** at the intersection of **Robotics** and **Machine Learning**. My specific
research interests include:

- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Space Robotics**
- **Robotic Manipulation**
- **3D Perception**

I am open to collaboration on any of these topics. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together!
